Pushback: understanding and responding to risks is always politicized

why? because risks are invisible, we have to delegate power to scientists to measure them and tell us what is "acceptable" or "tolerable". we become vulnerable to misinformation 

we can't "see" causality - we have to be told
paradoxically, knowing the causal linkages can cause us to deny our own experiential evidence
e.g. knowledge of climate change can affect accuracy of weather recall

> Many of the newer risks (nuclear or chemical contaminations, pollutants in foodstuffs, diseases of civilization) completely escape human powers of direct perception. The focus is more and more on hazards which are neither visible nor perceptible to the victims; hazards that in some cases may not even take effect within the lifespans of those affected, but instead during those of their children; hazards in any case that require the "sensory organs" of science - *theories, experiments, measuring instruments - in order to become visible or interpretable as hazards at  all.*
