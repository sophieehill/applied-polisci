It's normal to feel apprehensive when you see a famous person trending on Twitter: *did they die or... is it just their birthday?*

But my fellow millenials will understand that there's a particular *type* of apprehension we experience when we see "J.K. Rowling" trending: *what has she done now?*

(Zoomers: on behalf of my generation, I accept your [roasting](https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/gen-z-dragging-millennials-tiktok). Please be gentle.)

In the past, Rowling seemed content to use her enormous platform to [spread](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/12/19/jk-rowing-maya-forstater-tweets-transphobia-accusations/) and [legitimize](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/06/25/jk-rowling-under-fire-following-transphobe-twitter/) [anti-trans](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/18/jk-rowling-transphobic-transgender-twitter-tweets-alex-drummond/) [talking points](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/07/jk-rowling-anti-trans-gender-women-period-lgb-alliance-harry-potter-backlash/) whilst using her professional PR team to [mitigate any damage to her book sales](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/03/22/jk-rowling-reps-blame-middle-aged-moment-for-liking-tweet-calling-trans-women-men-in-dresses/). 

But in recent months, it seems that her PR team has been turfed out, leaving Rowling free to, erm, TERF-out -- with a [3,000 word blog post](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/) entitled "J.K. Rowling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking out on Sex and Gender Issues".

Some called it a "[transphobic manifesto](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/j-k-rowling-doubles-down-what-some-critics-call-transphobic-n1229351)". But I think it's really Rowling's very own [Bad Guy Speech](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gk8ya/top-10-film-villains-alex-denney-192). 

You know, the speech right at the end of the movie, when we see the villain up close and - apropos of nothing - they launch into an extended biographical 

While there are many variations on this theme, a Bad Guy Speech really has just two core components: 

1. the Bad Guy *admits* to their villainy
2. the Bad Guy shows a little *humanity*

But then of course, there's the explanations. 

There's no more hiding behind 

What struck me right away, as the title indicates, is that Rowling wasn't really seeking to justify her views *per se*, but to explain why she felt compelled to speak out. 

As a result, the text is 
    




Villain-splaining - a word I just made up - refers to the kind of long-winded post-hoc rationalization that the baddie offers up towards the end of the book/movie/play, filling in crucial plot details and character motivations along the way.





But, just like with mansplaining, the problem with villain-splaining isn't that it's boring. (Though it is. Oh god, it is.) It's that *we already know the answers*, and in fact we can see them with clearer eyes than the 'splainer themselves.




In the first tweet, back in December 2019, Rowling stated her support for Maya Forstater, a tax expert whose contract with a think tank was not renewed after she made a series of transphobic tweets.

``` {r, fig.align="center"} 
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1207646162813100033")
```

The key point of contention in this case was whether Forstater's view that "transwomen are men" constitutes a philosophical belief that is covered under the Equality Act 2010. If so, it would count as unlawful discrimination for her employer to choose not to renew her contract due to this belief.

But, obviously, there are restrictions on what kind of beliefs receive this protection. While Forstater's belief meets many of the required criteria -- for example, her belief is sincerely held, it meets a reasonable threshold of cogency, it applies to an important aspect of human life -- an [employment tribunal ruled](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12P9zf82TicPs2cCxlTnm0TrNFDD8Gaz5/view) that it failed the final test. In order for a belief to be protected, it must be worthy of respect in a democratic society, not be incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.

Contrary to Rowling's tweet, Forstater was not pushed out of her job for "stating that sex is real". As the judgment makes clear, the issue is that Forstater's belief conflicts with the legal right of someone who has obtained a Gender Recognition Certificate to be recognized and treated as a member of the sex to which they have transitioned.

> When questioned during live evidence the Claimant stated that biological males cannot be women. She consider [sic] that if a trans woman says she is a woman that is untrue, even if she has a Gender Recognition Certificate. [Maya Forstater v CGD Europe and others: 2200909/2019]

So far this is rather bog-standard TERF talk. But it was this more recent tweet by Rowling that really caught my attention:

``` {r, fig.align="center"} 
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1269382518362509313")
```

Apparently the use of the phrase "people who menstruate" finally pushed Rowling over the edge, since she followed it up a few days later with a [3,000 word letter](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/) published on her website, entitled "J.K. Rowling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking out on Sex and Gender Issues".

Did Rowling actually read the article that she tweeted about? We can't say for sure, but I for one struggle to understand what could be objectionable about using the phrase "people who menstruate" in an article about, uh, menstrual health.

A more nuanced objection would be that language such as "people who menstruate" might tend to obscure the underlying gendered dynamics of issues like menstrual health. Not all women menstruate and not all those who menstruate are women. But access to menstrual materials may still be deeply connected with gender-based rights and attitudes.

And, well, this is exactly what the article says! While the headline refers to "people who menstruate", the authors then highlight gendered societal norms as an important factor in menstrual health:

> Strong taboos and stigma persist around menstruation in all corners of the world, restricting the lives of girls and women from engaging in the activities of daily life, and creating feelings of shame and embarrassment. ... Communication messaging aimed at households and families, including men and boys, may emphasize the support needed to manage menstruation during a pandemic, potentially contributing to lasting positive societal change. [[devex blog post](https://www.devex.com/news/sponsored/opinion-creating-a-more-equal-post-covid-19-world-for-people-who-menstruate-97312#.XtwLnv0aEeR.twitter), 28 May 2020]

In her self-published letter, Rowling continues her objection. Language like "menstruators", she says, is "dehumanising and demeaning", and, like the "degrading slurs spat at us by violent men", it is "hostile and alienating". 

Phew! This is... pretty strong stuff And look, don't get me wrong, I understand that describing people based on one particular aspect can be reductive and offensive, in many contexts.

![](/post/2020-06-22-expecto-transphobum_files/jk_30rock.gif)

But Rowling herself recognizes that the intent behind such language is *not* to dehumanize anyone, but simply to be inclusive. She writes: "I understand why trans activists consider this language to be appropriate and kind, but for those of us who've had degrading slurs spat at us by violent men, it’s not neutral, it’s hostile and alienating."

And so I found myself puzzling over this reaction. How can something be seen as both kind and hostile? As both inclusive and alienating?

One possible answer, I think, lies in the way we think about categories. 

Lumping things together into categories is our way of making the world simpler and more predictable. We don't need to uniquely identify an animal to know that "big teeth" = danger.

The classical theory of categories is probably familiar to most of us. It's basically... Venn diagrams!

![](/post/2020-06-22-expecto-transphobum_files/jk_venn2.jpg)

When something falls inside a circle, that means it belongs to that category. When the circles overlap, it means there are instances of things that belong to both categories. But, crucially, each *thing* is either inside a given circle, or not. So belonging to a category is a binary concept: it is or it isn't.

What Venn diagrams fail to capture is the idea that some things or groups are more *representative* of a particular category than others. So, for example, robins and ostriches both fall under the larger category of birds, but (at least in the U.S. context) most people will say that robins are more representative of the category "bird" than ostriches. 

The idea of *gradation* within categories has been around for a long time, but it was the psychologist [Eleanor Rosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rosch) who turned this insight into "prototype theory" in the 1970s.

A *prototype* is a member of a group that shares a maximum number of attributes with other group members, and a minimum number of attributes with non-group members. So, while a robin and an ostrich both have some classic "bird" attributes (wings, feathers), the robin has *more* bird-like attributes (flight, song) and *fewer* un-bird-like attributes (huge, terrifying).

Prototype theory also applies to the categories that *we* belong to. For example, @danbold2015no show that White Americans tend to rate their own group as more representative of "the values and ideals of America" -- i.e. more prototypical -- than other racial and ethnic groups.

<details>
<summary>Tell me more about this study </summary>
@danbold2015no recruited 194 White American participants on MTurk. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and White Americans represent the values and ideals of America on a 7-point scale (1 = least representative to 7 = most representative). On average, the White American participants in this study rated their own group at around 6 on the 7-point scale, while the other groups were rated around 4 to 5.
</details>

One way to think about Rowling's rather extreme reaction to the phrase "people who menstruate" is that she's experiencing *prototypicality threat* -- the reaction produced when a subgroups prototypicality is threatened. 

So, for example, if we asked people to imagine a person who menstruates, they would probably imagine a ciswoman. That's because the subgroup of ciswomen is seen as prototypical of this larger group. (Note: this is still true even though of course many ciswomen do not menstruate.) 

By using the phrase "people who menstruate", the authors of this article were intentionally leveling the playing field -- referring to the larger group rather than its prototypical subgroup. And that can be threatening, because being prototypical feels good! Group members tend to think of themselves as prototypical, and are socially rewarded when they are seen as prototypical by others [@wenzel2008superordinate]. 

Let's go back to the example from @danbold2015no. In their study, they showed participants one of two graphs: a graph showing that whites and ethnic minorities were project to grow at a similar pace, or a graph showing that whites would be outnumbered by ethnic minorities.

<center>

![**Figure 3 from @danbold2015no**](/post/2020-06-22-expecto-transphobum_files/danbold_fig3.png)

</center>

The participants who were shown the graph on the right hand side experienced more prototypicality threat than those who were shown the graph on the left hand side -- that is, they were more likely to agree with statements like: "Compared to today, 50 years from now what it means to be a true American will be less clear" or "50 years from now, the typical American and people like me will have less in common than in the past".

This seems strikingly reminiscent of Rowling's reaction - that language like "menstruators" is "[alienating](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/)". Or, as she has [written elsewhere](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1269389298664701952), that "erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives".

Prototypicality threat isn't just an uncomfortable feeling -- it's also reduces tolerance for diversity. So, in @danbold2015no, the projection of a "majority minority" America caused an increase in White Americans' prototypicality threat, and a *decrease* in diversity endorsement. That is, participants who experienced prototypicality threat were less likely to agree with statements like: "It is important to have multiple perspectives in America (i.e., from different cultures, races, and ethnicities)".
