One Hundred Years of Silence

How did 8 minutes 46 seconds become the symbol of the George Floyd protests?

8 minutes 46 seconds. That was the length of time that prosecutors said police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd's neck.


In fact, prosecutors later issued a correction -- it was actually 7 minutes 46 seconds -- after the Associated Press pointed out that the original timestamps

But the number had already become the symbol of the movement.

Protestors across the U.S. and, indeed, the world held moments of silence for the duration of 8 minutes 46 seconds.

There is an inherent theatricality to these silences. 



While congressional Democrats [knelt](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-congressional-democrats-hold-moment-of-silence-to-honor-george-floyd), protestors in [Pittsburgh](https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20200607/8-minutes-46-seconds-police-brutality-protests-reveal-uncomfortable-truths-prompt-local-action), [Sacramento](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article243321501.html), [Boston](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/george-floyd-protest-planned-for-boston-common-wednesday/2136307/) laid face down on the ground in a symbolic "die-in".

And these two performances were intertwined in a subversive reenactment when activists in Bristol knelt on the neck of the toppled statue of Edward Colston, a man who profited from the enslavement of tens of thousands of men, women, and children.



It may seem strange to puzzle over these performances. Holding moments of silence is a familiar practice, both as remembrance and as protest. And the symbol - 8 minutes and 46 seconds - communicated one of the most horrifying aspects of the incident. That is couldn't possibly be chalked up to a "split second reaction" or an adrenaline-fuelled mistake. 

But turning "8 minutes 46 seconds" into a silent protest only seems natural to us because it is part of a familiar *repertoire*.

This was the analogy that Charles Tilly famously used to understand why methods of protest seem so constrained at particular points in time:

> On one side, people who make contentious claims in a given time and place draw on a very limited repertoire of performances. Most of the performances are sufficiently familiar that participants know more or less how to behave and what to expect. London’s skilled workers of the 1760s knew about assembling outside Mansion House and calling on the Lord Mayor, just as middle-class Londoners of the 1830s knew how to conduct a public meeting and how to send Parliament a petition. Those performances only change slowly and incrementally. But they do change continuously; even the public meetings of 1834 look somewhat different from the public meetings of 1768.

> On the other side, no two contentious performances mirror each other perfectly. Indeed, they would lose some of their effect if they operated like precision military drill. Participants improvise constantly in two different ways: figuring out how to shape the available routines to communicate the claims they are currently pursuing, and responding to other people’s reactions as they make the claims. They interact with other participants, onlookers, objects of claims, competitors, and authorities. In the process, they introduce minor innovations into established forms. Most of those innovations disappear as the event ends. But some stick. As a result, some performances disappear, others come into being, and most others modify incrementally.
