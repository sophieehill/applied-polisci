Tarrow on "modular" repertoires

e.g. mock funerals for liberty in early America (c.f. mitch mcconnell's "RIP socialism", lol)

One reason for the popularity of the barricade was that it helped people form
new collective identities. As they faced off against hostile troops, the defenders
of a barricade came to know each other as comrades and developed a division
of labor among fighters, builders, and suppliers, thereby forming networks of
comrades that would bring them together in future confrontations.
