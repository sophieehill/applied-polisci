Tarrow on "modular" repertoires

e.g., obvious example = the modern "Tea Party"
but also: 
e.g. mock funerals for liberty in early America (c.f. mitch mcconnell's "RIP socialism", lol)

p.116
And protesters against sexual crimes
against children march in white clothing – as they did in Belgium in 1996 – to
symbolize the purity of the victims (Hooghe and Deneckere 2003).

some repertoires build capacity

e.g. Tarrow p.53
One reason for the popularity of the barricade was that it helped people form
new collective identities. As they faced off against hostile troops, the defenders
of a barricade came to know each other as comrades and developed a division
of labor among fighters, builders, and suppliers, thereby forming networks of
comrades that would bring them together in future confrontations.

Why Edward Colston’s statue should have stayed up

Edward Colston sleeps with the fishes. A mob of Bristolians has toppled the statue of one of their city’s founding fathers, Saddam-style, and lobbed the poor fellow into the docks. Other footage on social media shows protesters kneeling on his brass neck, as if he had something to do with modern-day police brutality in the United States. What on earth has caused this madness, which looked like violent scenes from the English reformation?
