Tarrow p.37

In the mid-1780s, as the foundations of France’s old regime were crumbling, a
series of scandal trials began to unfold in Paris.1 In one of the most notorious,
the Cleraux affair, a servant who had resisted the advances of her master ´
was accused of robbing him and was hauled into court. Not only was the
case decided in her favor (pace Dickens), but a wave of outrage against the
courts and the lewd master surged across Paris. In a routine that had become
familiar by the late eighteenth century, the master’s house was sacked, his
goods thrown into the street, and he himself barely saved from the fury of the
crowd. A contemporary observer described the emotion ´ in this way:


What violences! What tumults! A furious multitude filled the streets, straining
to tear down the Thibault house with an ax, then threatening to burn it;
covering the family with curses and outrages; almost sacrificing them to their
hatred (Lusebrink 1983: 375–376).


footnote:
In his “Speaking Your Mind Without Elections” (1983), Tilly describes the “sacking routine”
as common in the eighteenth century, observing that it was frequently used to punish tavern or
brothel keepers who cheated their customers, or public officials who had passed the bounds of
legitimacy. Its use to punish a venal householder who had abused a servant seems to have been
an innovation of the pre-revolutionary period. It continues to appear throughout the French
Revolution, most dramatically in the Reveillon riots of May 1789. (On the latter, see Simon
Schama’s vivid reconstruction in Citizens 1989: 326–332).
