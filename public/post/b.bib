	Abstract = {Labor unions play a central role in the Democratic party coalition, providing candidates with voters, volunteers, and contributions, as well as lobbying policymakers. Has the sustained decline of organized labor hurt Democrats in elections and shifted public policy? We use the enactment of right-to-work laws---which weaken unions by removing agency shop protections---to estimate the effect of unions on politics from 1980 to 2016. Comparing counties on either side of a state and right-to-work border to causally identify the effects of the state laws, we find that right-to-work laws reduce Democratic Presidential vote shares by 3.5 percentage points. We find similar effects in US Senate, US House, and Gubernatorial races, as well as on state legislative control. Turnout is also 2 to 3 percentage points lower in right-to-work counties after those laws pass. We next explore the mechanisms behind these effects, finding that right-to-work laws dampen organized labor campaign contributions to Democrats and that potential Democratic voters are less likely to be contacted to vote in right-to-work states. The weakening of unions also has large downstream effects both on who runs for office and on state legislative policy. Fewer working class candidates serve in state legislatures and Congress, and state policy moves in a more conservative direction following the passage of right-to-work laws.},

@article{hawkins2003populism,
	Abstract = {In the 1990s Venezuela experienced the rise of a new anti-party movement built around the figure of Hugo Ch\&\#xe1;vez and dedicated to the fundamental transformation of society, a movement that most Venezuelans call Chavismo. If we define populism in strictly political terms--as the presence of what some scholars call a charismatic mode of linkage between voters and politicians, and a democratic discourse that relies on the idea of a popular will and a struggle between 'the people' and 'the elite'--then Chavismo is clearly a populist phenomenon. Chavismo relies on charismatic linkages between voters and politicians, a relationship largely unmediated by any institutionalised party. It also bases itself on a powerful, Manichaean discourse of 'the people versus the elite' that naturally encourages an 'anything goes' attitude among Ch\&\#xe1;vez's supporters. In this paper I demonstrate these points through a descriptive account, based on interviews performed in Caracas during autumn 1999, May 2000 and February 2003, as well as on published texts available in Venezuela. I also use this account to support an analytical claim that these populist qualities undermine Chavismo's democratic goals.},

	Abstract = {A long-standing line of inquiry in legislative research has dealt with the social backgrounds, recruitment, and career experiences of legislators. This review essay begins by considering the ways in which opportunities to serve in a legislative assembly are distributed in a variety of societies. It then reviews studies of the motives, incentives, and goals of persons seeking legislative offices, and assesses the relationship between the opportunity to serve as a legislator and the desire to do so. Next it considers the processes through which people become members of legislative assemblies, especially contrasting the United States with non-American systems. Finally, the essay takes stock of research on the careers of legislators, and notes findings on the professionalization of the legislative career.},

@incollection{kitschelt2001partisan,
	Abstract = {This is the third of three chapters on the implications of electoral politics and the design of political institutions for welfare state adjustment. Kitschelt's main proposition is that the strategic configuration of party systems, net of public opinion on social policy reforms, is a critical force that shapes social policy reform programmes and their implementation. He lays out mechanisms that may induce politicians to pursue often unpopular reforms based on internal opportunities offered by the dynamic of competitive party democracy that have received only scant attention in the comparative political economy and social policy literature. The central guiding proposition of the chapter requires two important qualifications: first, that the dynamic of party competition is only one of several mechanisms that affect social policy retrenchment; and second, that a comparative study of social policy change in the 1980s and 1990s would ideally rely on equivalent measures across a wide range of countries, but cross‐nationally comparable measures are not available. These data limitations currently make it impossible to determine the explanatory power of internal political conditions relative to external demographic and economic changes in accounts of social policy retrenchment, so Kitschelt uses case studies from Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Japan to illustrate how mechanisms of party competition impinge on social policy change, and beyond that, attempts to generalize his argument based on a reading of much looser expert judgements about social policy retrenchment in a broader set of countries.},

	Abstract = {This study examines public preferences over deficits, taxes, and spending. Using responses to public opinion questions designed for the purpose, the article assesses the state of preferences as expressed by individuals and as represented in government. One section examines the characteristics of individual preferences-their completeness, consistency, and coherence. Public opinion is remarkably well structured and overwhelmingly partial to the policy status quo. A second section explores the properties of mass preferences as they are aggregated by several different kinds of institutional voting rules. Institutions matter, at least to a point: Consistent institutional differences over federal budget policy trace directly to the diverse means by which institutions represent the public's positions. The conclusion assesses the meaning and import of the public's resistance to budget policy change.},

@article{alvarez1994uncertainty,
	Abstract = {While the world of politics is uncertain, previous work, both theoretical and empirical, has largely failed to incorporate this uncertainty into the analysis of public opinion and electoral behavior. In this article we discuss measures designed to elicit the uncertainty survey respondents feel about their political perceptions. These measures exhibit response patterns which are interpretable, substantively interesting, and consistent with a model relating uncertainty to citizen information costs. We also find that variation in respondent uncertainty leads to different models of perception of political figures and speaks to models of the survey response. As a practical matter, our measures can easily be incorporated into existing surveys with no disruption of continuity.},

	Abstract = {Voters penalize federal and state spending growth. This is the central result of my analysis of voting behavior in Presidential, Senatorial, and gubernatorial elections from 1950--1988. The composition of federal spending growth seems irrelevant. The vote loss to the President's party from an extra dollar of defense or nondefense spending is the same. However, in gubernatorial elections, expansion of state welfare spending exacts a disproportionate political price. Deficit financing of federal or state spending does not appear to matter politically. I conclude by discussing the obvious question of why government budgets have grown in the face of this voter hostility.},

@article{tomz2007countries,
	Abstract = {This paper uses a new dataset to study the relationship between economic output and sovereign default for the period 1820-2004. We find a negative but surprisingly weak relationship between economic output in the borrowing country and default on loans from private foreign creditors. Throughout history, countries have indeed defaulted during bad times (when output was relatively low), but they have also suspended payments when the domestic economy was favorable, and they have maintained debt service in the face of adverse shocks. This constitutes a puzzle for standard theories of international debt, which predict a much tighter negative relationship as default provides partial insurance against declines in output.},

	Abstract = {Much of the literature on international institutions argues that membership regularizes expectations about members' future behavior. Using the accession of the postcommunist countries as a test case, this article argues that the EU can send strong signals to financial markets about the trajectory of a particular country. Examining spreads on sovereign debt from 1990 to 2006, this article shows that closing negotiation chapters on domestic economic policy\&\#x2014;in other words, receiving a seal of approval from Brussels that previously existing policy reform is acceptable to the wider EU\&\#x2014;substantially decreases perceptions of default risk in those countries. That decrease operates independently from policy reform that the country has taken and is also distinct from selection processes (modeled here with new variables, including UNESCO World Heritage sites and domestic movie production, that proxy for cultural factors). Thus, this particular international organization has played an important role in coordinating market sentiment on members, conferring confidence that policy reform alone could not accomplish.},

A single principal component accounts for 64 percent of the variation in sovereign credit spreads. Furthermore, sovereign credit spreads are more related to the US stock and high-yield markets than they are to local economic measures. We decompose credit spreads into their risk premium and default risk components. On average, the risk premium represents about a third of the credit spread.},

Our bargaining-theoretic approach allows us to handle the effects of uncertainty on sovereign debt contracts in a much more satisfactory way than in earlier analyses.

	Abstract = {Der vorliegende Aufsatz versucht, die gegenseitige Beeinflussung verschiedener Kr\&\#xe4;fte in Gro\&\#xdf;britannien zu analysieren, die zu Starrheiten der Kosten und Preise f\&\#xfc;hrten, und gleichzeitig die Bedeutung abzusch\&\#xe4;tzen, die sie f\&\#xfc;r das Scheitern des Goldstandards im Jahre 1931 hatten. Das Wesen und die Bedeutung dieser Faktoren, die eine Anpassung verhinderten, wird besonders deutlich, wenn man Gro\&\#xdf;britanniens gro\&\#xdf;e Abh\&\#xe4;ngigkeit vom Au\&\#xdf;enhandel betrachtet. Dar\&\#xfc;ber hinaus macht die zehnprozentige \&\#xdc;berbewertung des Sterlings im Jahre 1925 eine besondere Untersuchung der Anpassung einer entwickelten Volkswirtschaft an die Weltwirtschaft notwendig. Die wirtschaftliche Lage Gro\&\#xdf;britanniens hatte sich schon vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg zu verschlechtern begonnen, der Krieg erschwerte sie noch mehr. Eine Untersuchung dieser Periode ergibt, da\&\#xdf; sowohl exogene als auch endogene Faktoren eine Anpassung erforderlich machten. Die exogenen Faktoren waren: langfristige \&\#xc4;nderungen in der Nachfrage auf dem Weltmarkt, verringerte Kaufkraft der direkten Abnehmerl\&\#xe4;nder, verst\&\#xe4;rkte Industrialisierung und zunehmender Wettbewerb auf dem Weltmarkt und hohe Schutzz\&\#xf6;lle. Diese Faktoren entzogen sich einer direkten Beeinflussung. Daher wurden die endogenen Faktoren, n\&\#xe4;mlich erh\&\#xf6;hte L\&\#xf6;hne und Unkosten, ausschlaggebend. Allein Gro\&\#xdf;britannien widersetzte sich einer Anpassung dieser Faktoren. Die abnehmende Konkurrenzf\&\#xe4;higkeit seines Exporthandels war teilweise eine Reflexwirkung der zunehmenden Starrheiten der Volkswirtschaft. F\&\#xfc;r die Analyse in dem vorliegenden Aufsatz werden die Kr\&\#xe4;fte, die diese Starrheiten bewirkten, in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt: in lebendige Kr\&\#xe4;fte, die aus Menschen bestehen, die ihre wirtschaftlichen und politischen Kr\&\#xe4;fte innerhalb des institutionellen Systems geltend machen, und unbeseelte, mechanische Kr\&\#xe4;fte, die dem System eigen sind. F\&\#xfc;r Gro\&\#xdf;britannien waren die haupts\&\#xe4;chlichsten lebendigen Kr\&\#xe4;fte: die wachsende Macht der Arbeiterschaft, Lohnsenkungen Widerstand entgegenzusetzen, die Hemmungen der Wirtschaft, \&\#xdc;berschu\&\#xdf;kapazit\&\#xe4;ten stillzulegen und Investitionen in modernen Anlagen vorzunehmen, und der zunehmende Druck auf die Regierung, die Wirtschaftsunsicherheit zu beheben. Die unbeseelten Kr\&\#xe4;fte kamen teils aus dem Wirtschaftssystem (z. B. aus der zunehmenden Unbeweglichkeit der Arbeitskr\&\#xe4;fte und des fixen Kapitals sowie aus dem gr\&\#xf6;\&\#xdf;eren Risiko der Veralterung der Fabrikeinrichtungen), teils aus politischen Ursachen, n\&\#xe4;mlich z. B. aus dem traditionell konservativen Wesen des demokratischen Prozesses. Wenn auch andere Faktoren zu dem Fehlschlagen des Goldstandards beitrugen, sollte doch kein Zweifel dar\&\#xfc;ber bestehen, da\&\#xdf; dann, wenn die gleiche Anpassungsf\&\#xe4;higkeit bestanden h\&\#xe4;tte, die das neunzehnte Jahrhundert charakterisierte, die Entwicklung des Goldstandards einen ganz anderen Verlauf genommen h\&\#xe4;tte.},

	Abstract = {This paper surveys the recent literature on sovereign debt and relates it to the evolution of the legal principles underlying the sovereign debt market and the experience of the most recent debt crises and defaults. It finds limited support for theories that explain the feasibility of sovereign debt based on either external sanctions or exclusion from the international capital market and more support for explanations that emphasize domestic costs of default. The paper concludes that there remains a case for establishing institutions that reduce the cost of default but the design of such institutions is not a trivial task.},

	Abstract = {We examine the role of noneconomic partnerships in promoting international economic exchange. Since far-sighted countries are more willing to join costly international partnerships such as environmental treaties, environmental engagement tends to encourage international lending. Countries with such noneconomic partnerships also find it easier to engage in economic exchanges since they face the possibility that debt default might also spill over to hinder their noneconomic relationships. We present a theoretical model of these ideas and then verify their empirical importance using a bilateral cross-section of data on international cross-holdings of assets and environmental treaties. Our results support the notion that international environmental cooperation facilitates economic exchange.},

The goal of this spending is to maintain public support for trade liberalization. We provide a micro-level test of the critical assumption behind the embedded liberalism thesis that government programs designed to protect individuals harmed by imports reduce opposition to free trade. Our micro results have important implications for the macro relationship between trade and government spending, which we also test. We find empirical support for the embedded liberalism thesis in both our micro- and macro-level analyses.},

@article{edwards2006public,
	Abstract = {Empirical studies of public opinion regarding globalization have to date addressed only economic integration. By way of comparison, we know much less about public opinion regarding cultural globalization. In addition, there has been little head-to-head testing of alternative explanations for public opinions in these areas. I contrast four arguments: skills, partisanship, economic evaluations, and beliefs about the free market, consumerism, and modern life, which I test using survey information taken from 17 developed and developing countries from 2002. I find that values are a powerful and under-studied explanation for variations in public opinion. Regardless of whether the question dealt with economic or cultural globalization, views about the free market, consumerism, and modern life had more explanatory power than evaluations of the economy or partisanship, and roughly the same explanatory powers as skill levels. These findings provide important insights into the sources of the globalization backlash and have important implications for how globalization should be both studied and theorized.},

@article{rankin2001identities,
	Abstract = {There is increasing attention to the mass public in the politics of trade debate, yet we still know little about how Americans formulate opinion on trade. Scholars are puzzled by the ineffectiveness of traditional dispositional beliefs to account for trade policy judgment, while an emerging economic self-interest perspective contends that opinion on trade is based on material concerns. This article demonstrates how symbolic predispositions provide critical information shortcuts for Americans on trade in which the relationship between trade policy and economic self-interest may be unclear. Symbolic politics theory explains how citizens can rely on accessible symbolic predispositions, including conceptions of national identity, in an unfamiliar and evolving trade policy environment often subject to multiple and conflicting cues, limited political information, and changing economic circumstances.},

@article{elman2002lakatos,
	Abstract = {Despite the popularity of Imre Lakatos's ideas and numerous references to his Methodology of Scientific Research Programs (MSRP), IR scholars often misstate and misapply his criteria for appraising theoretical development. This article provides a more complete description of Lakatos's metric, addresses a number of critiques related to its use, and surveys how MSRP has been used to evaluate IR research. It suggests that IR proponents of Lakatos's methodology could better appreciate the limits of its application, and that those who use his metric could do so in a more informed way. The article argues for a sustained discussion about the promises and difficulties of theory appraisal, and suggests that MSRP may be a useful point of departure for that dialogue. It calls for IR theorists to undertake comparative analyses of different rationalist metrics to provide the basis for making informed judgments about their different strengths and weaknesses in helping to produce better theories.},

The HOV model is utilized to derive the probable effect of a liberalization move on the returns to different Canadian occupations.

It is found that these agents took positions that were generally consistent with the prediction from the HOV model. /// La performance du mod\&\#xe8;le Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek dans la pr\&\#xe9;vision des forces politiques endog\&\#xe8;nes au niveau individuel.

@article{midford1993international,
	Abstract = {Ronald Rogowski's work offers valuable insight into the impact of changing trade exposure on domestic politics. Exploring the political implications of the well-known factor endowments model of international trade theory, Rogowski argues that owners of relatively abundant productive factors will form a free-trading coalition against owners of relatively scarce productive factors, who will align in favor of protection. Rogowski's parsimonious three-factor version of the factor endowments theory--although offering valuable insight into the politics of less developed economies, including today's developed economies in earlier centuries--produces significant nomalies when applied to advanced economies. Intuitive logic and empirical research, especially the Leontief paradox, suggest that the highly complex division of labor found in developed countries will confound the simplicity of the three-factor model. Edward Leamer's multifactor model suggests solutions to the anomalies that afflict Rogowski's simpler model when applied to recent politics in the United States and Europe.},

	Abstract = {We address the question of how international public goods are financed by analyzing voting in the U.S. Congress on legislation to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We argue that legislators are more likely to vote in favor of an increase (1) the more campaign contributions they obtain from banks that specialize in international lending, and (2) the greater the share of high-skilled "proglobalization" workers in their districts. The first argument supports the inference that a financially strong IMF mitigates the risks of international lending, to the benefit of the lending banks. The second reflects our claim that voters view the IMF as a positive force for global economic integration that-following Stolper-Samuelson reasoning-benefits high-skilled workers. Lastly, we analyze IMF loan decisions and find modest support for the claim that IMF policy reflects the interests of major international banks. Overall, our results suggest that private actors within the United States have individual stakes in funding the IMF.},

	Abstract = {Analysts have long suspected that politics affects the lending patterns of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but none have adequately specified or systematically tested competing explanations. This paper develops a political explanation of IMF lending and tests it statistically on the developing countries between 1985 and 1994. It finds that political realignment toward the United States, the largest power in the IMF, increases a country's probability of receiving an IMF loan. A country's static political alignment position has no significant impact during this period, suggesting that these processes are best modeled dynamically. An analysis of two subsamples rejects the hypothesis that the IMF has become less politicized since the end of the cold war and suggests that the influence of politics has actually increased since 1990. The behavior of multilateral organizations is still driven by the political interests of their more powerful member states.},

Analysis of monthly data on 53 African countries from 1990 to 2000 shows that the IMF's loans-for-reform contract lacks credibility because donor countries intervene to prevent rigorous enforcement. Countries that have influence with developed-country patrons-as measured by U.S. foreign aid, membership in postcolonial international institutions, and voting profiles in the UN-are subject to less rigorous enforcement (shorter program suspensions). They have more frequent program suspensions, because they violate their conditions more often. The IMF will have to become more independent in order to become an effective champion of reform.},

A new data set drawn from the IMF's records of conditionality provides an opportunity to study the bargaining process within an important international organization and answer questions about the institution's autonomy. I find evidence of U.S. influence, which operates to constrain conditionality, but only in important countries that are vulnerable enough to be willing to draw on their influence with the United States. In ordinary countries under ordinary circumstances, broad authority is delegated to the IMF, which adjusts conditionality to accommodate local circumstances and domestic political opposition. The IMF has refrained from exploiting the vulnerability of particular countries to maximize the scope of conditionality.},

A panel data analysis of 206 letters of intent from 38 countries, submitted during the period April 1997 through February 2003, revealed that the number of conditions on an IMF loan depended on a borrowing country\&\#x2019;s voting pattern in the UN General Assembly. Closer allies of the United States (and other Group of 7 [G7] countries) received IMF loans with fewer conditions, especially prior to elections.

@article{momani2006assessing,
	Abstract = {The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual Article IV consultation meetings and ensuing reports are external assessments of member states' economies by highly regarded international economists, designed to ensure that member states conform to IMF-prescribed liberal economic standards. For non-borrowing advanced industrialized countries, like Canada, what is the perceived utility of these annual Article IV consultations? Constructivists suggest that the adept staff of international organizations (IO) teach state civil servants and officials how to better formulate sound policies. However, constructivists need to engage in further empirical study to back up their theoretical assumptions about IO teaching and state learning. Based on personal interviews with Department of Finance staff involved in Article IV consultations and on content analysis of IMF reports on Canada, this paper contributes an empirical study on whether the Fund staff "teaches" and Canada's finance department staff "learns" from the annual surveillance exercises. The findings of this paper suggest that although involved Canadian Finance personnel appreciate meeting with the Fund staff as an academic and intellectual exchange, the policy advice they receive in the Article IV consultations rarely, if ever, changes their economic analyses, because the Fund's advice tends to not be practical. Based on suggestions from Department of Finance staff, as well as IMF evaluations of its bilateral surveillance, this paper concludes with recommendations from the finance staff on how to improve on the utility of Article IV consultations. /// Les r\&\#xe9;unions annuelles de consultation au titre de l'article IV du Fonds mon\&\#xe9;taire international (FMI) et les rapports suivant sont des \&\#xe9;valuations externes pour les \&\#xe9;conomies des \&\#xe9;tats membre, par des \&\#xe9;conomistes internationaux tres reconnu, con\&\#xe7;u pour assurer que ces \&\#xe9;tats membre conforme aux normes \&\#xe9;conomiques lib\&\#xe9;rales prescrit par le FMI. Pour les pays industrialis\&\#xe9;s avanc\&\#xe9;s non-empruntant, comme le Canada, quel est l'utilit\&\#xe9; per\&\#xe7;ue de ces Consultations annuelles au titre de l'article IV? Les constructivists sugg\&\#xe8;re que fonctionnaires habile des organisations internationales (OI) enseigne des fonctionnaires de l'\&\#xe9;tat pour qu'ils puissant mieux forumler leur politique. Cependant, les suppositions th\&\#xe9;oriques des constructivists a propos de l'enseignement des OI et l'\&\#xe9;rudition des \&\#xe9;tats ont besoins d'\&\#xe9;tude empirique plus ample pour expliquer leurs arguments. Bas\&\#xe9; sur des entretiens personnels avec les personnel du D\&\#xe9;partement de Finance impliqu\&\#xe9; dans les consultations au titre de l'article IV et sur l'analyse des contenu des rapports de l'FMI sur le Canada, cette article contribue une \&\#xe9;tude empirique pour determin\&\#xe9; si le personnel des Fonds 'enseigne' et le personnel du d\&\#xe9;partement de finance du Canada 'apprend' a travers les exercices de surveillance annuels.

	Abstract = {IMF-supported programs focus on key objectives (such as growth, inflation, and the external current account) and on intermediate policy targets (such as monetary and fiscal policies) needed to achieve these objectives. In this paper we use a new, large data set, with information on 94 programs between 1989 and 2002, to compare programmed objectives and policy targets to actual outcomes. We report two broad sets of results. First, we find that outcomes typically fell short of expectations in growth and inflation but were broadly in line with the programmed external current account objectives. Similarly, programmed intermediate policy targets were generally more ambitious than the intermediate policy outcomes. Second, focusing on growth, we examine the relationship between objectives and policy targets, and find differences in the way ambitious monetary and fiscal targets affected the achievement of the growth objective. On the one hand, more ambitious fiscal targets, even when they were missed, led to better growth performance. On the other hand, more ambitious monetary targets tended to be associated with lower growth performance.},

@article{vreeland2003governments,
	Abstract = {Why do governments and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) enter into agreements? Conventional wisdom holds that governments turn to the Fund for a straightforward reason: they need an IMF loan. An alternative argument is that governments want IMF conditions to be imposed to help push through unpopular economic reforms. To illustrate how the desire for IMF conditions can play a role in the decision to enter into an agreement, this article considers two analytically significant cases. Drawing upon a data set of 7011 country-year observations of 199 countries from 1952 (or year of independence) to 2000, two outliers are selected: the country observed with the least need for an IMF loan participating in an IMF program (Uruguay in 1990) and the country with the strongest need for an IMF loan not participating in an IMF program (Tanzania in 1983). /// Pourquoi les gouvernements font-ils appel au Fond Mon\&\#xe9;taire International? Il est g\&\#xe9;n\&\#xe9;ralement admis que les gouvernements font appel au FMI pour une raison tr\&\#xe8;s simple: ils ont besoin d'un pr\&\#xea;t. Une autre th\&\#xe9;orie est que les gouvernements souhaitent se pr\&\#xe9;valoir des conditions impos\&\#xe9;es par le FMI pour justifier la mise en \&\#x153;uvre de r\&\#xe9;formes \&\#xe9;conomiques impopulaires. Pour illustrer \&\#xe0; quel point les conditions du FMI jouent un r\&\#xf4;le dans la conclusion des accords, nous choisissons deux exemples repr\&\#xe9;sentatifs tir\&\#xe9;s d'une importante \&\#xe9;tude statistique: le cas de l'Uruguay en 1990 et celui de la Tanzanie en 1983.},

	Abstract = {The Supreme Court's ruling in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services increased the political saliency of the abortion issue. Since pro-choice and pro-life groups within the constituencies of U.S. legislators paid closer attention to abortion-related roll call votes after Webster, the legislators' voting behavior on such issues might have changed as a result of the decision. Accordingly, voting model estimates for abortion funding issues before and after Webster are used to examine changes in the role of legislators' personal policy preferences and the role of policy preferences among their constituency on voting on this issue. The results show that legislators, to some extent, vote according to their personal preferences on abortion funding issues. Moreover, the influence of personal preferences on voting behavior did not change substantially after Webster, despite the change in the outcome of the vote.},

@article{nooruddin2006politics,
	Abstract = {A central component of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs is reducing government budget deficits. We ask how domestic political considerations shape the distribution of cuts made by governments in IMF programs. Our central finding is that IMF programs shrink the role played by domestic politics. While democracies allocate larger shares of their budgets to public services in the absence of IMF programs, the difference between democracies and nondemocracies disappears under IMF programs. This result has important implications for our understanding of government spending priorities under different resource constraints.},

	Abstract = {How much weight should be assigned to a particular factor in explaining an outcome? How should an abstract concept be linked to empirical indicants? These methodological problems-known as the "how much" and "how to" problems, respectively-have raised serious obstacles for ideational researchers. However, they have generally failed to deal with these problems adequately. To offset the limitations of existing studies, this paper provides new methodological guidance to researchers confronting these problems. In particular, quantitative methods are suggested for managing the "how much" problem, and a new indicator based on an individual's organizational background is proposed to deal with the "how to" problem. To develop the argument, this guidance is applied to examine the effect and measurement of the emergence within the International Monetary Fund of neoliberal ideas prescribing liberalization of capital controls.},

	Abstract = {In the fast-moving world of development policy, buzzwords play an important part in framing solutions. Today's development orthodoxies are captured in a seductive mix of such words, among which 'participation', 'empowerment' and 'poverty reduction' take a prominent place. This paper takes a critical look at how these three terms have come to be used in international development policy, exploring how different configurations of words frame and justify particular kinds of development interventions. It analyses their use in the context of two contemporary development policy instruments, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPS) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS). We show how words that once spoke of politics and power have come to be reconfigured in the service of today's one-size-fits-all development recipes, spun into an apoliticised form that everyone can agree with. As such, we contend, their use in development policy may offer little hope of the world free of poverty that they are used to evoke.},

	Abstract = {British political parties are usually capable of dictating the voting behavior of their members in the House of Commons, but there are instances in which the parties choose to grant MPs freedom to vote as they wish. These "free votes" occur on private members' bills and frequently involve extremely emotional, important issues. Using multiple regression analysis, we examine voting on selected free votes since 1966. The results suggest that while partisan forces are potent even on free votes, they are by no means the only forces operating. Personal characteristics of the MPs\&\#x2014;such as religion, age, education, and the like\&\#x2014;also influence voting decisions. Moreover, at times it is even possible to observe characteristics of the constituencies (religion, region, and marginality) affecting voting decisions. We conclude by discussing what these findings mean for views of decision making in the House of Commons.},

The results indicate that constituency characteristics matter, but they also underline the central importance of party. Even when discipline is not imposed, the Members of the three largest parties are distinct from one another. Moreover, there is a noteworthy interaction between constituency and party: the more marginal the seat, the more extreme the position. Members appear to react to electoral threat by reinforcing partisan bona fides with their local party rather than conforming to the median, recognizing the importance of partisanship for electoral success and the role of local party resources.},

@article{finnemore1998international,
	Abstract = {Norms have never been absent from the study of international politics, but the sweeping "ideational turn" in the 1980s and 1990s brought them back as a central theoretical concern in the field. Much theorizing about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role in creating political change, but change processes have been less well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle" of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress will only be made by placing attention on the connections between norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

@article{wendt1992anarchy,
	Abstract = {It is informed that the debate between realists and liberals has reemerged as an axis of contention in international relations theory. This article deliberates on to what extent the state action is influenced by "structure" versus "process" and institutions. The debate between "neorealists" and "neoliberals" has been based on a shared commitment to "rationalism." Classical realists such as Thomas Hobbes, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hans Morgenthau attributed egoism and power politics primarily to human nature, whereas structural realists or neorealists emphasize anarchy. The difference stems in part from different interpretations of anarchy's causal powers. It is opined that self-help is an institution, one of various structures of identity and interest that may exist under anarchy. Processes of identity-formation under anarchy are concerned first and foremost with preservation or "security" of the self. Concepts of security therefore differ in the extent to which and the manner in which the self is identified cognitively with the other, and, the author wants to suggest, it is upon this cognitive variation that the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power depends.},

@article{keohane1988international,
	Abstract = {To understand international cooperation and discord, it is necessary to develop a knowledge of how international institutions work, and how they change. The assumption of substantive rationality has proved a valuable tool in pursuing such knowledge. Recently, the intellectual predominance of the rationalistic approach has been challenged by a "reflective" approach, which stresses the impact of human subjectivity and the embeddedness of contemporary international institutions in pre-existing practices. Confronting these approaches with one another helps to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each. Advocates of the reflective approach make telling points about rationalistic theory, but have so far failed to develop a coherent research program of their own. A critical comparison of rationalistic and reflective views suggests hypotheses and directions for the development of better-formulated rationalist and reflective research programs, which could form the basis for historically and theoretically grounded empirical research, and perhaps even for an eventual synthesis of the two perspectives.},

	Abstract = {A central claim of both Marxist and neoclassical political theory is that under capitalism all governments must respect and protect the essential claims of those who own the productive wealth of society. This is the theory of @'structural dependence of the state on capital.@' Using a formal model, the internal logic and the robustness of the theory is examined. We conclude that in a static sense the theory is false: virtually any distribution of consumption between wage earners and owners of capital is compatible with continual private investment once an appropriate set of taxes and transfers is in place. Yet the state may be structurally dependent in a dynamic sense. Policies that, once in place, redistribute income without reducing investment do reduce investment during the period in which they are anticipated but not yet implemented.},

@article{weatherford1984economic,
	Abstract = {Declining trust in politicians and political institutions is one of the most dramatic and well-documented trends in American public opinion. Confidence in religious, educational and other institutions has also waned, but emphasis has focused on diminished political trust, both because it may summarize a wide range of diffuse grievances and because it might indicate an increased potential for disruptive action, political violence and instability. In the decade from 1968 to 1978, the level of political trust (measured by the conventional five-item CPS/NES index) was halved, the proportion of the public expressing moderate or high levels of trust falling from 64 to 33 per cent. The greatest decline in the index level (a drop of 14 points) occurred between 1972 and 1974.},
