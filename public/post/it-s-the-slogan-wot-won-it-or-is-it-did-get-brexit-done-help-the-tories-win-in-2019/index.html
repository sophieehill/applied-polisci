<p><em>[TL;DR: Probably not.]</em></p>
<p>“Get Brexit Done.” Those were <a href="https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/">“the three words that helped Boris Johnson win”</a> Britain’s 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.</p>
<p>The slogan was a “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/get-brexit-done-perhaps-greatest-example-golden-slogan-lifetime/">golden key</a>” that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, this Spectactor columnist thinks it was a “<a href="https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/the-genius-of-boriss-brexit-slogan/">work of of political genius</a>”, with “power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise”.</p>
<p>Even prominent Labour figures like John McDonnell said that the slogan had “<a href="https://labourlist.org/2019/12/i-dont-think-our-narrative-was-good-enough-says-mcdonnell/">successfully resonated</a>” with voters.</p>
<p>What these analyses share – aside from an occasionally breathless tone – is a strange conception of what politics <em>is</em>…</p>
<p>We might call it <em>politics as electoral spellcasting</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>: the idea that if you can just find the right sequence of magic words – Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done – you can “resonate” your way to electoral victory.</p>
<p>If you think I’m being uncharitable in this depiction, witness how the media has depicted Dominic Cummings (Vote Leave campaign chief and now advisor to Boris Johnson): an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dominic-cummings-evil-svengali-behind-19522317">evil Svengali</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street">master of the dark arts</a>, or (my personal favourite) the Demon Headmaster?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-01-09-it-s-the-slogan-wot-won-it-or-is-it-did-get-brexit-done-help-the-tories-win-in-2019_files/cummings1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>So… is this narrative true?</p>
<p>Did the “Get Brexit Done” slogan actually affect the election result?</p>
<p>Do campaign slogans really have the power to change minds?</p>
<div id="reasons-for-skepticism" class="section level3">
<h3>Reasons for skepticism</h3>
<div id="fundamentals" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Fundamentals</h4>
<p>One big reason for being skeptical about campaign effects is that we can do a pretty big job at predicting election results just using information from <em>before the campaign starts</em>.</p>
<p>Typically the predictors we use are “fundamental” factors like the state of the economy and the government’s approval rating, measured pre-campaign.</p>
<p>What’s really striking is that even in the age of waning party attachments and (supposedly) increasingly sophisticated campaigns, fundamental factors do as good a job in predicting election results now as they did 50 years ago <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nadeau2019election">1</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="experimental-evidence" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Experimental evidence</h3>
<p>If we <em>really</em> want to know whether something has a causal effect, then, just like with a medical trial, we need to do a controlled experiment.</p>
<p>How does this work for political “treatments” instead of medical ones? Well, typically a researcher will partner with a political candidate or party, and convince them to randomize some aspect of their campaign - e.g. by flipping a coin to decide where to send your door-to-door canvassers, or where to air your TV ads, or where to send your leaflets.</p>
<p>A big difficulty here is that campaigns vary a lot! Some canvassers are more persuasive than others. Some candidates might just have the right message for the right time. So rather than relying on any one particular study, we want to sort of “average” over a bunch of existing studies.</p>
<p>This is called a “meta-analysis”. Strikingly, two big meta-analyses of persuasive campaign effects find that our best guess is that the effects are zero <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kalla2018minimal"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citation">@coppock2019persuasive</span>]</span></p>
<p>lots of other studies claiming to find big effects relating to subtle linguistic cues (e.g. describing someone as a “voter” increases likelihood of voting??) have been debunked:
- <strong>???</strong> big replication shows that subtle linguistic cues (describing the recipient as a “voter”) don’t have huge turnout effects!
- lots of results have been debunked…
<strong>???</strong> finds no difference between -ve or +ve framing on norms</p>
<p>When we do observe large effects, they decay very quickly. <strong>???</strong> shows that campaign mobilization effects decay very quickly</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>availability bias. campaign messaging is often eye-catching and memorable. whether it’s a clever word play, a slightly silly promise (Get Brexit Done) or just completely outrageous, they stick in our minds. but this does not mean they change our minds! rather, it means that when we want to explain an apparent shift in voter preferences, these messages are easily accessible. A stonking Tory victory in 2019? Well, “Get Brexit Done” clearly resonated.</li>
</ol>
<p>evidence that individual slogans tend to get overblown - e.g. death panels written about extensively in media but not used very much by politicians and almost never volunteered by voters when talking about healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="competing-messages" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Competing messages</h3>
<p>One interesting outlier study finds a campaign effect that persists for years</p>
<p><strong>???</strong> shows that campaign effects can last for YEARS - how?? because it was a one-sided campaign. this is v v unusual!</p>
<p>but this is an important point. our evidence suggests that political campaigns don’t have much of a NET effect. but that doesn’t mean that politicians and parties should abandon these efforts to save resources. just like in a tug of war, some investment in campaigning may be necessary to hold off the other side, even if winning outright is impossible because both teams match evenly.</p>
<p>the competing messages aren’t just coming from other parties’ campaigns. it could be from the media, or indeed from other voters! social media has opened up many opportunities for voters to contextualize campaign messages for each other.</p>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dounoucos2019message">2</a>]</span> campaign tweet depends on comments underneath - amplified by positive but BIG negative if comments negative!</p>
</div>
<div id="backfire" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Backfire</h3>
<p>another reason campaigns might not work is that… they’re annoying?</p>
<p><strong>???</strong> having an elected official email highlighting a particular issue does not increase issue salience - in fact it seems to lead to backfire efffects where citizens downgrade the highlighted issue and express LESS interest in signing a petition about it!!</p>
<p>It can even backfire - one study found that voters who were randomly assigned to receive a “persuasive” pro-Obama message on their doorstep were actually <em>less likely</em> to vote for Obama <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bailey2016unresponsive">3</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="ok-so-do-campaigns-matter-at-all" class="section level3">
<h3>OK so… do campaigns matter at all?</h3>
<p>probably yes! one reason for null effects in field experiments is that you are competing with lots of other messages. zero net effect does not mean zero direct effect! imagine a tug of war…</p>
<p>so far we’ve focused on persuasion - e.g. vote for me, not the other guy. that’s hard. but campaigns may be more effective when it comes to mobilization (who turns out) and priming (which issues are seen as most important).</p>
</div>
<div id="so-maybe-get-brexit-done-worked-after-all" class="section level3">
<h3>So maybe Get Brexit Done worked after all?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>did it mobilize pro-Conservative voters and/or demobilize others? maybe… although claims are mixed: some say it appealed to distrusting brexiteers, others say it appealed to remainers who were fatigued.</p></li>
<li><p>did is prime the issue of brexit? hard to see evidence of this… brexit was already a MIP going into the election… MII time series doesn’t show much change - in fact it is health that grew in importance over the course of the campaign.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>???</strong> show no effect of TV debates</p>
<p>parties and politicians are betting at responding to the issue priorities of the voters than at shaping them…</p>
<p><strong>???</strong> analyzes 10 years’ worth of press releases by German parties
<strong>???</strong> analyze tweets sent by US legislators and citizens and show that legislators tend to follow, rather than lead, the public’s issue priorities</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-political-science-say-about-campaign-effects" class="section level3">
<h3>What does political science say about campaign effects?</h3>
<p>Political scientists have long been skeptical about whether political campaigns actually have an effect on voters, for one simple reason.</p>
<p>We can predict election outcomes <em>surprisingly well</em> based on “fundamental” factors like the state of the economy and vote intentions that are measured well <em>before</em> the campaign has started.</p>
<p>Even in recent years, when party attachments are waning, voter volatility is rising, and campaigns are (supposedly) becoming more sophisticated, fundamental factors like the economy are still just as good at predicting elections now as they were 50 years ago <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nadeau2019election">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good sense of how this debate has evolved just by glancing at the titles of a few books written on this subject…</p>

<div id="so-why-do-politicians-spend-so-much-money-on-campaigns" class="section level3">
<h3>So… why do politicians spend so much money on campaigns?</h3>
<p>Ah! An important point. When we say the “campaigns have small effects” were talking about NET effects. Think of it as a tug of war. If both teams are composed of tug-of-war professionals, both have information about the other team, both have the ability to add players to their team if needed, we tend to end up with a draw. but that doesn’t mean that pulling the rope has no effect!</p>

<div id="what-is-the-campaign" class="section level3">
<h3>What is “the campaign”?</h3>
<p>What do we actually mean by “the campaign”?</p>
<p>It might be useful to break it down into two components: content and contact.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong> is the message: everything from which issues the campaign chooses to emphasize, down to specific slogans.</p>
<p>slogans, That includes things like slogans, images, and emphasisis on some issues over others.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong> is how the campaign actually reaches voters. That includes leaflets, door-to-door canvassing, TV adverts, as well as “indirect contact” via the media (think: leadership debates, press coverage of campaign rallies).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-political-campaigns-aim-to-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What do political campaigns (aim to) do?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobilization</strong>: changing who turnouts on election day.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be broad-based (e.g. civic GOTV campaigns) or partisan (increase turnout among your likely voters, decrease among your opponent’s likely voters).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persuasion</strong>: changing who they vote for
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Direct persuasion: change vote choice by directly changing voter’s preferences</li>
<li>Priming: change vote choice by changing issue salience</li>
<li>Informing: change vote choice by changing factual beliefs (e.g. about the current unemployment rate)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Persuasion is expensive because it takes resources to actually reach voters</p>
<p>And because the effects wear off, fast! One study from a 2006 gubernational race in the US found that a randomly-assigned weekly ad buy could raise the candidate’s support by up to 5 percentage points - but this effect had disappeared by the following week <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-gerber2011large">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>meta-analyses based on large-scale field experiments:
<strong>???</strong>
<strong>???</strong> (sometimes detect an effect but overall v modest)</p>
<p>effects of a <em>particular slogan</em>:
<strong>???</strong> on “death panels” - this particular wording does not crop up in text analysis of politicians speech nor of citizens open ended survey responses…</p>

<h3>Upbeat conservatives vs pessimistic Labour?</h3>
<p>note: consistent finding from PS that anger is mobilizing!</p>
<p>most persuasive effecs are fleeting - remember Cleggmania!
indeed, best evidence from field experiments is that the effect of persuasion = 0</p>
</div>
<div id="campaign-effects-vs-effects-during-campaigns" class="section level3">
<h3>Campaign effects vs effects during campaigns</h3>
<p>show leadership ratings graph. voters pay more attention during campaigns, so go through a process of reevaluating based on “fundamentals” - e.g. state of the economy, pre-campaign perception of leaders, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-explains-differences-between-2017-and-2019" class="section level3">
<h3>What explains differences between 2017 and 2019?</h3>
<p>main campaign effect= information
hence biggest effects when voters start with low precision priors
corbyn was a relatively unknown quantity in 2017 - only been leader for 2 years, never fought a general election - so big campaign effect!
hard to expect this to repeat itself again in 2019…</p>
</div>
<div id="cameron-vs-cummings" class="section level3">
<h3>Cameron vs Cummings?</h3>
<p>note that lots of the focus groups that cited the “Get Brexit Done” slogan also cited Cameron/Osborne’s debt mongering! e.g. the anecdote about “there’s no money left”. cumulative effect - you don’t start a campaign with a blank slate.</p>
