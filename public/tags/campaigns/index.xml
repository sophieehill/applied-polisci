      <description>“Labour economic policies are popular, so why aren’t Labour?”
 As this analysis from YouGov suggests, Labour’s policy proposals were popular when taken one-by-one, but when voters step back and evaluate which party would do best on the economy overall, Labour is at a severe disadvantage.
Voters were twice as likely to pick Boris Johnson (34%) over Jeremy Corbyn (16%), when asked who they trusted most to run the economy.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: No.
“Get Brexit Done.” Those were “the three words that helped Boris Johnson win” Britain’s 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.
It was a “golden key” that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.
Not to be outdone, this Spectactor columnist thinks it was a “work of of political genius”, with “power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise”.
Even prominent Labour figures like John McDonell said that the slogan had “successfully resonated” with voters.</description>
