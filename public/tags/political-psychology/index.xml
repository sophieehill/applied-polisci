      <description>In the Harry Potter books, when a witch or wizard wants to cast a Patronus Charm, they have to fixate on a particularly happy memory.1 If successful, they can produce a corporeal Patronus – an animal formed of dazzling, blinding light – that can drive away Dementors.
What about us mere muggles? Well, we do things a little differently. Often, when we need a defensive boost, we tend to fixate on bad memories – instances where we were wronged or victimized.</description>

      <description>Political scientists have often wondered how to reconcile two basic facts:

 Many voters manage to vote “correctly” - that is, they vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with their stated preferences
  How do they do it?
There are two basic models of how voters process information: memory-based processing and the online tally.</description>
