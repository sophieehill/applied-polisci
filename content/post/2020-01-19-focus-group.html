<h3>Proofiness</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a more basic question: if we wanted to show that campaign slogans affect election results, what kind of evidence would we need?</p>
<p>One answer - suggested by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/johnsons-get-brexit-done-strategy-resonates-with-marginal-focus-groups">many</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c75273fe-183d-11ea-8d73-6303645ac406">commentators</a> - is to ask voters why they are voting the way they are. And, lo and behold, many participants in these focus groups explicitly said they were voting Conservative <em>in order to Get Brexit Done</em>.</p>
<p>A smoking gun, surely? Straight from the voter’s mouth!</p>
<p>Perhaps not. These anecdotes are closer to <em>proofiness</em> that, erm, proof.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Voters are not the best guides to what is in their heads.</p>
<p>They underestimate how much their beliefs are affected by others in a group discussion, even misremembering their initial attitudes <span class="citation">[@keating2016partisan]</span></p>
<p>voters do not actually place more weight on the issue they say is “most important” <span class="citation">[@bartle2012telling]</span></p>
<p><span class="citation">@theodoridis2017me</span> voters don’t just have implicit attitudes, they also have implicit <em>identities</em>. it has been well-known, for example, that many of those who identify as independents who, say, lean towards the Democratic party in the US, look much more like Democrats than pure Independents… this paper demostrates this with an implicit association test that forms a much better scale of partisan attachment!</p>
