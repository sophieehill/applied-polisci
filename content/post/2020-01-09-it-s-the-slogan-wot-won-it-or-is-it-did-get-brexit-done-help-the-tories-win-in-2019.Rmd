*TL;DR: No.*

"Get Brexit Done." Those were ["the three words that helped Boris Johnson win"](https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/) Britain's 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.

It was a "[golden key](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/get-brexit-done-perhaps-greatest-example-golden-slogan-lifetime/)" that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.


Not to be outdone, this Spectactor columnist thinks it was a "[work of of political genius](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/the-genius-of-boriss-brexit-slogan/)", with "power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise".

Even prominent Labour figures like [John McDonell](https://labourlist.org/2019/12/i-dont-think-our-narrative-was-good-enough-says-mcdonnell/) said that the slogan had "successfully resonated" with voters.

What these analyses share -- aside from an occasionally breathless tone -- is a strange conception of what politics *is*. 

We might call it *politics as electoral spellcasting*^[Inspired by Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's term, "[politics as electoral spectacle](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oQ8mv52KmBIC&pg=PA101&dq=%22politics+as+electoral+spectacle%22+pierson&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI7eCNy_zmAhVRuXEKHdr-BagQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22politics%20as%20electoral%20spectacle%22%20pierson&f=false)"]: that if you can only find the right sequence of magic words -- Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done -- you can "resonate" your way to electoral victory.

If you think I'm exaggerating here, witness how the media has depicted Dominic Cummings (Vote Leave campaign chief and now advisor to Boris Johnson): as an [evil Svengali](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dominic-cummings-evil-svengali-behind-19522317), a [master of the dark arts](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street), or (my personal favourite) the Demon Headmaster?^[For the uninitiated: watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQyPSJYZxk), but don't look into his eyes!]

But is this narrative true? 

Did the "Get Brexit Done" slogan actually affect the election result?

Do campaign slogans really have the power to change minds?


### What does political science say about campaign effects?

Political scientists have long been skeptical about whether political campaigns actually have an effect on voters, for one simple reason.

We can predict election outcomes *surprisingly well* based on "fundamental" factors like the state of the economy and vote intentions that are measured well *before* the campaign has started. 


You might think: well, perhaps campaigns didn't matter much in the past, but surely they do now? After all, we live in a time of declining party attachments, and hence [rising voter volatility](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/press-release-most-volatile-british-electorate-in-modern-times/#.XZxwbUZKiUk). Plus, aren't campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated, finding new ways to test messages and target voters? 

Alas, a recent study finds that fundamental factors are still just as good at predicting elections across a democracies now as they were 50 years ago [@nadeau2019election]. 

Never mind! Luckily, political scientists have come up with a rather neat explanation for why campaigns matter, even when they (erm) don't seem to change much...


You can get a pretty good sense of how this debate has evolved just by glancing at the titles of a few books written on this subject...

### What is "the campaign"?

What do we actually mean by "the campaign"? 

It might be useful to break it down into two components: content and contact.

**Content** is the message: everything from which issues the campaign chooses to emphasize, down to specific slogans.

slogans, That includes things like slogans, images, and emphasisis on some issues over others. 

**Contact** is how the campaign actually reaches voters. That includes leaflets, door-to-door canvassing, TV adverts, as well as "indirect contact" via the media (think: leadership debates, press coverage of campaign rallies).

### What do political campaigns (aim to) do?

- **Mobilization**: changing who turnouts on election day.


This could be broad-based (e.g. civic GOTV campaigns) or partisan (increase turnout among your likely voters, decrease among your opponent's likely voters).


- **Persuasion**: changing who they vote for
  (i) Direct persuasion: change vote choice by directly changing voter's preferences
  (ii) Priming: change vote choice by changing issue salience
  (iii) Informing: change vote choice by changing factual beliefs (e.g. about the current unemployment rate)


Persuasion is expensive because it takes resources to actually reach voters

And because the effects wear off, fast! One study from a 2006 gubernational race in the US found that a randomly-assigned weekly ad buy could raise the candidate's support by up to 5 percentage points - but this effect had disappeared by the following week [@gerber2011large].


and risky. It can even backfire - one study found that voters who were randomly assigned to receive a "persuasive" pro-Obama message on their doorstep were actually *less likely* to vote for Obama [@bailey2016unresponsive].



mobilizing:
- street signs (Panagapoulos, 2009)

@dounoucos2019message 


harder than you think - backfire effects!

### Upbeat conservatives vs pessimistic Labour?

note: consistent finding from PS that anger is mobilizing! 

most persuasive effecs are fleeting - remember Cleggmania!
indeed, best evidence from field experiments is that the effect of persuasion = 0


### Campaign effects vs effects during campaigns

show leadership ratings graph. voters pay more attention during campaigns, so go through a process of reevaluating based on "fundamentals" - e.g. state of the economy, pre-campaign perception of leaders, etc. 



### What explains differences between 2017 and 2019?

main campaign effect= information
hence biggest effects when voters start with low precision priors
corbyn was a relatively unknown quantity in 2017 - only been leader for 2 years, never fought a general election - so big campaign effect!
hard to expect this to repeat itself again in 2019... 


### Secret sauce vs 

quote the golden key thing
explain Zaller
carrier bag of bits and bobs analogy

### Cameron vs Cummings?

note that lots of the focus groups that cited the "Get Brexit Done" slogan also cited Cameron/Osborne's debt mongering! e.g. the anecdote about "there's no money left". cumulative effect - you don't start a campaign with a blank slate.
