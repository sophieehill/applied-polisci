Statues are, obviously, three dimensional. But the *politics* of statues -- as we've seen unfolding on the streets of London and many other cities in recent weeks --

But political scientists have long understood the *politics* of statues in two dimensions.

In fact, if you've ever seen the "political compass" meme, you're probably already familiar with this way of dividing up the political space!

```{r fig.align = "center"}
blogdown::shortcode("gallery-slider", dir="/images/compass/", width="500px", height="500px")
```

In short, the horizontal axis indicates position on economic issues (state intervention in the economy; redistribution) and the vertical axis indicates position on cultural (or "values") issues.

Political scientists have observed for many decades that protest politics seems to be dominated by the bottom-left quadrant: the left-libertarians.

It's worth pointing out that this is still true, despite the right of the populist and radical right across Europe!

For example, [@hutter2019challenges] created a huge dataset of nearly 20,000 protest events in 6 European countries from 1975-2011, based on newspaper reports. They coded the protest events based on the issue (environment; cultural liberalism; immigration; European integration) and the position being expressed.

The first two panels of this figure show that immigration and the EU have become increasingly salient in protest politics, both in terms of the number of events and the number of participants.

However, the left-libertarian dominance remains, because the third panel shows that on average, even the immigration protests are still mostly *pro* immigration!

(Here, the "pro" positions are coded as +1 while the "anti" positions are coded as -1. So when the average is positive, that means the protests on that issue lean towards the "pro" side.)

We can certainly see a downward trend, indicating that immigration/integration protests have shifted towards the "anti" position over time. And clearly protests on these issues are much more evenly split that protests on the environment and cultural liberalism (e.g., LGBT rights), which are overwhelmingly dominated by the "pro" position.

Still, it's a remarkable result given the dramatic successes of anti-immigration parties at the polls.

So... why do the left-libertarians tend to dominate the sphere of "protest politics", even when they are struggling in the electoral sphere?

## Sore losers?

Perhaps this isn't so much of a contradiction after all. Maybe left-wingers are more inclined to take to the streets precisely *because* they aren't having so much success at the ballot box?

It's an appealing logic. But the protest sphere has been dominated by left-wingers long before the electoral decline of mainstream left parties.

In fact, a recent study [@torcal2016word] showed that while left-wingers are *more* likely to protest under a right-wing (vs left-wing) government, they are still the most likely group to be protesting under a left-wing government!

## Demographics

Another explanation that we can quickly dispense with is the claim that left-libertarians tend to protest more simply because they have the luxury of being highly-educated and mostly well-off.

Many studies have documented that those with libertarian values are more inclined to take part in protests than those with authoritarian values, even controlling for a range of individual demographics, such as age, gender, and educational attainment.

(That is: even if we just compare individuals of the same age, gender, and education, those who are more libertarian still tend to protest more.)

## Protest values and valuing protest

Perhaps libertarians dominate the protest sphere simply because libertarian values are more conducive to protest politics than authoritarian values?

Libertarians are more comfortable than authoritarians with types of political action that challenge the status quo.

Indeed, many political scientists argued that these value orientations can help us to understand why the populist right -- which pits "the people" against a corrupt political system -- tends to use highly-institutionalized channels (elections and referenda) instead of protest politics to acheive its goals.

> Rebels on the right tend to have authoritarian and materialist values and prefer (orderly) conventional political action over (disorderly) protest politics, whereas rebels on the left tend to share libertarian and postmaterialist values, which predispose them for unconventional protest politics. For challengers on both the left and the right, the "medium is the message"; that is, the choice of the channel in which they express themselves is at the same time an expression of their underlying message. [@hutter2013movements]

However, more recent scholarship has questioned this left/right binary. For example, [@pirro2020populism] find that the clearest divide in non-electoral participation (NEP) seems to be between the non-populist right and everybody else.

(The authors measure "non-electoral participation" by creating a scale that reflects how many actions like contacting a politician, signing a petition, demonstrating, the respondent has done.)

Having libertarian (vs authoritarian) values still makes someone more likely to take part in protests, and other forms of non-electoral participation.However, right-wing populist parties may be able to overcome the values "disadvantage" of their supporters in other ways.

For example, [@marx2018anti] show that populist parties help to increase the political efficacy of low-income citizens, by increasing political attention and simplifying the political terrain. Indeed, they find that low-income citizens are more likely to engage in non-electoral participation when populist parties have had electoral success.

## 

Another possible explanation is given by [@flanagan2003new], who suggest that while libertarians are able to effectively mobilize around specific issues that directly affect particular groups, authoritarians instead face an overwhelming barrage of symbolic attacks on the status quo.

> Most of these new left issues represent the intense interests of small minorities. Because they intensely desire new rights, which will directly affect their condition or chosen lifestyle, they are highly motivated to become politically involved. Conversely, authoritarians are not generally personally invested in any one of these issues. Rather they see the world around them changing in ways that threaten their core beliefs, but these threats take the form of multiple attacks, multiple brushfires. Because they cannot become involved in all of them at once, they often complain but do nothing. [@flanagan2003new, p.260]

I'm not entirely sure about this argument. It's true that many "minority rights" movements -- e.g. LGBT rights -- have been led by individuals from minority groups who have a direct stake in the issues. But any successful social movements needs to mobilize a broader coalition in the end.

Whether its the multi-racial crowds protesting against police brutality or the multi-generational crowds marching to protect the environment, mobilizing those who are *not* directly affected by an issue is a hallmark strategy of left-libertarian social movements.

(Think of Bernie Sanders' famous 2020 rallying cry: [Are you willing to fight for someone you don't know?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mu-K6da4Os))

The rising salience of immigration for the populist and mainstream right in recent decades also casts doubt on the idea that authoritarians are unable to prioritize issues and mobilize effectively.

## Right reputation

One possibility for explaining the assymmetry in protest mobilization is that the unpredictable and sometimes messy nature of the protest sphere poses particular reputational risks for those on the right.

As [@hutter2013movements] put it:

> Populist radical right leaders and followers try to set themselves apart from their adversaries on the left, who are viewed as "chaotic" protesters. At the same time, populists try to set themselves apart from the extreme and neofascist right---not only for historical but also for more practical reasons. If those who openly advocate the most right-wing and racist ideologies take part in protest events organized or supported by populist radical right parties, then the populists run the risk of being equated with them. [@hutter2013movements]

In fact, the logic of this argument applies just as much (if not more so) to the mainstream right as it does to the populist and radical right.

And surely there's no better illustration of the difficulty of this task of "double differentiation" than Priti Patel, the UK Home Secretary, using exact the same word ("thuggery") to describe Black Lives Matter protestors who toppled a statue and far-right counter-protestors who assaulted police officers.

## Mapping out the two dimensions

So... after all that, what do we know about the terrain of statue politics?

Well, we know that those who hold libertarian values are more inclined to protest than those who hold authoritarian values, even holding demographics constant.

However, populist right parties have been able to overcome this values deficit to mobilize their supporters.

So the really interesting part of the map is the right-middle area -- the domain of the mainstream right. This area is interesting because it is the harder space for protest politics to occur.

So what does this look like? Well, the Society of Merchant Venturers seems like a rather helpful example of a mainstream right-wing organization. And how have they responded to this particular moment? Well, after decades of opposing calls for the statue's removal, and intervening in a proposal to change the statue's plaque to provide a more accurate summary of Colston's life, the SMV has now quietly admitted that its actions were inappropriate and that the statue should have come down.
