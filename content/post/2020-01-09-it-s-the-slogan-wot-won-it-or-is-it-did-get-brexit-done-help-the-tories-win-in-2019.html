<p><em>TL;DR: No.</em></p>
<p>“Get Brexit Done.” Those were <a href="https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/">“the three words that helped Boris Johnson win”</a> Britain’s 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.</p>
<p>It was a “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/get-brexit-done-perhaps-greatest-example-golden-slogan-lifetime/">golden key</a>” that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, this Spectactor columnist thinks it was a “<a href="https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/the-genius-of-boriss-brexit-slogan/">work of of political genius</a>”, with “power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise”.</p>
<p>Even prominent Labour figures like <a href="https://labourlist.org/2019/12/i-dont-think-our-narrative-was-good-enough-says-mcdonnell/">John McDonell</a> said that the slogan had “successfully resonated” with voters.</p>
<p>What these analyses share – aside from an occasionally breathless tone – is a strange conception of what politics <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>We might call it <em>politics as electoral spellcasting</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>: that if you can only find the right sequence of magic words – Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done – you can “resonate” your way to electoral victory.</p>
<p>If you think I’m exaggerating here, witness how the media has depicted Dominic Cummings (Vote Leave campaign chief and now advisor to Boris Johnson): as an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dominic-cummings-evil-svengali-behind-19522317">evil Svengali</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street">master of the dark arts</a>, or (my personal favourite) the Demon Headmaster?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>But is this narrative true?</p>
<p>Did the “Get Brexit Done” slogan actually affect the election result?</p>
<p>Do campaign slogans really have the power to change minds?</p>
<div id="what-does-political-science-say-about-campaign-effects" class="section level3">
<h3>What does political science say about campaign effects?</h3>
<p>Political scientists have long been skeptical about whether political campaigns actually have an effect on voters, for one simple reason.</p>
<p>We can predict election outcomes <em>surprisingly well</em> based on “fundamental” factors like the state of the economy and vote intentions that are measured well <em>before</em> the campaign has started.</p>
<p>You might think: well, perhaps campaigns didn’t matter much in the past, but surely they do now? After all, we live in a time of declining party attachments, and hence <a href="https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/press-release-most-volatile-british-electorate-in-modern-times/#.XZxwbUZKiUk">rising voter volatility</a>. Plus, aren’t campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated, finding new ways to test messages and target voters?</p>
<p>Alas, a recent study finds that fundamental factors are still just as good at predicting elections across a democracies now as they were 50 years ago <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="nadeau2019election"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>.</p>
<p>Never mind! Luckily, political scientists have come up with a rather neat explanation for why campaigns matter, even when they (erm) don’t seem to change much…</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good sense of how this debate has evolved just by glancing at the titles of a few books written on this subject…</p>

<h3>What is “the campaign”?</h3>
<p>What do we actually mean by “the campaign”?</p>
<p>It might be useful to break it down into two components: content and contact.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong> is the message: everything from which issues the campaign chooses to emphasize, down to specific slogans.</p>
<p>slogans, That includes things like slogans, images, and emphasisis on some issues over others.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong> is how the campaign actually reaches voters. That includes leaflets, door-to-door canvassing, TV adverts, as well as “indirect contact” via the media (think: leadership debates, press coverage of campaign rallies).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-political-campaigns-aim-to-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What do political campaigns (aim to) do?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobilization</strong>: changing who turnouts on election day.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be broad-based (e.g. civic GOTV campaigns) or partisan (increase turnout among your likely voters, decrease among your opponent’s likely voters).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persuasion</strong>: changing who they vote for
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Direct persuasion: change vote choice by directly changing voter’s preferences</li>
<li>Priming: change vote choice by changing issue salience</li>
<li>Informing: change vote choice by changing factual beliefs (e.g. about the current unemployment rate)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Persuasion is expensive because it takes resources to actually reach voters</p>
<p>And because the effects wear off, fast! One study from a 2006 gubernational race in the US found that a randomly-assigned weekly ad buy could raise the candidate’s support by up to 5 percentage points - but this effect had disappeared by the following week <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gerber2011large"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>.</p>
<p>and risky. It can even backfire - one study found that voters who were randomly assigned to receive a “persuasive” pro-Obama message on their doorstep were actually <em>less likely</em> to vote for Obama <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bailey2016unresponsive"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>.</p>
<p>mobilizing:
- street signs (Panagapoulos, 2009)</p>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dounoucos2019message">1</a>]</span></p>
<p>harder than you think - backfire effects!

<h3>Upbeat conservatives vs pessimistic Labour?</h3>
<p>note: consistent finding from PS that anger is mobilizing!</p>
<p>most persuasive effecs are fleeting - remember Cleggmania!
indeed, best evidence from field experiments is that the effect of persuasion = 0</p>
</div>
<div id="campaign-effects-vs-effects-during-campaigns" class="section level3">
<h3>Campaign effects vs effects during campaigns</h3>
<p>show leadership ratings graph. voters pay more attention during campaigns, so go through a process of reevaluating based on “fundamentals” - e.g. state of the economy, pre-campaign perception of leaders, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-explains-differences-between-2017-and-2019" class="section level3">
<h3>What explains differences between 2017 and 2019?</h3>
<p>main campaign effect= information
hence biggest effects when voters start with low precision priors
corbyn was a relatively unknown quantity in 2017 - only been leader for 2 years, never fought a general election - so big campaign effect!
hard to expect this to repeat itself again in 2019…</p>

<div id="cameron-vs-cummings" class="section level3">
<h3>Cameron vs Cummings?</h3>
<p>note that lots of the focus groups that cited the “Get Brexit Done” slogan also cited Cameron/Osborne’s debt mongering! e.g. the anecdote about “there’s no money left”. cumulative effect - you don’t start a campaign with a blank slate.</p>
