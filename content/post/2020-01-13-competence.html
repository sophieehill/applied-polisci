<blockquote>
<p>“Labour economic policies are popular, so why aren’t Labour?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/12/labour-economic-policies-are-popular-so-why-arent-">analysis from YouGov</a> suggests, Labour’s policy proposals were popular when taken one-by-one, but when voters step back and evaluate which party would do best on the economy overall, Labour is at a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p>Voters were twice as likely to pick Boris Johnson (34%) over Jeremy Corbyn (16%), when asked who they trusted most to run the economy.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that in the wake of Labour’s electoral defeat, many have argued that Labour can only win if it convinces the voters that the party would be a competent steward of the economy.</p>

<p>and indeed empirically we see that parties that suffer valence damage tend to respond by moderating <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-clark2014understanding">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>note: now would be a good time to adjust policy, since research shows that voters only notice these shifts when there’s a fresh face leading the party <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="fernandez2019informational"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
<p>BUT: we have seen this before! march to the center = weakening party attachments…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The party’s transformation from an organization combining the
defense of social position, the quality of spiritual shelter, and the vision of things to come into that of a vehicle for short-range and interstitial political choice exposes the party to the hazards of all purveyors of nondurable consumer goods: competition with a more attractively packaged brand of nearly identical merchandise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLUS: voters discount opportunistic moves by parties. When mainstream parties move towards the centre, voters discount this. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-fernandez2018voter">3</a>]</span></p>

<h3>LEADER IS KEY</h3>

<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2019party">4</a>]</span> analyze results from 52 national election surveys from 13 Western European parliamentary democracies between 1974 and 2016. they show that leader effects (i.e. how much someone likes their most liked leader) have become more important to turnout, versus simple partisanship</p>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2018fostering">5</a>]</span> shows that this effect is driven by responses among prior non-voters

<h3>Other signals of competence</h3>
<p>using numbers conveys competence <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-pedersen2017politicians">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>individual legislators are perceived are more trustworthy when they dissent <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="campbell2016legislator"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="is-competence-all-important" class="section level3">
<h3>Is competence all-important?</h3>
<p>this study suggests that perceptions of <em>warmth</em> (think: trustworthiness, honesty, integrity) are actually more important than perceptions of competence in determining vote choice.</p>
<p>note they use survey data from the US and also a survey experiment to show causality <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laustsen2017relative">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>well, surely Labour has an advantage on that??</p>
<p>yes, in general RW parties own competence and LW parties own character <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bittner2011platform">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>yes, but actually a very small one in 2019…</p>
<p>so, a plausible alternative strategy is to really double down on “nasty party” attacks and hype up warmth…</p>
<p>indeed, warmth is more important to left-wing voters, while strong leadership (somewhat closer to competence?) is more important to right-wing voters…</p>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laustsen2017choosing">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>note: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-groenendyk2019two">10</a>]</span> show that a “good gut feeling” is crucial in helping low-turnout voters to overcome their ambivalence. “good gut feeling” is linked to warmth - who would you like to have a beer with.</p>

<h3>Competence is situationally dependent!</h3>
<p><span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laustsen2019online">11</a>]</span> show that dominance is associated with competence in times of “conflict” - but not otherwise. show panel waves. note, this effect overwhelms policy considerations among “non-memorizers”! what does this mean? people have multiple online tallies, and retrieve different ones in different contexts - imagine we gave 10 points to hufflepuff for being smart, etc. etc.</p>
