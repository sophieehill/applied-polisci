"Get Brexit Done." Those were ["the three words that helped Boris Johnson win"](https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/) Britain's 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.

The slogan was a "[golden key](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/get-brexit-done-perhaps-greatest-example-golden-slogan-lifetime/)" that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.

Not to be outdone, a Spectactor columnist wrote that it was a "[work of political genius](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/the-genius-of-boriss-brexit-slogan/)", with "power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise".

Even prominent Labour figures like John McDonnell said that the slogan had "[successfully resonated](https://labourlist.org/2019/12/i-dont-think-our-narrative-was-good-enough-says-mcdonnell/)" with voters.

And, of course, behind every good slogun is a mad slogun-slinger.

Enter Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave campaign chief and now advisor to Boris Johnson — a.k.a. the [evil Svengali](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dominic-cummings-evil-svengali-behind-19522317), [master of the dark arts](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street), or (my personal favourite) the Demon Headmaster?^[For the uninitiated: watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQyPSJYZxk), but don't look into his eyes!]

So... is this narrative true? 

Did the "Get Brexit Done" slogan actually affect the election result?

Do campaign slogans really have the power to change minds?

### Reasons for skepticism



#### 1. Fundamentals

One big reason for being skeptical about campaign effects is that we can do a pretty good job at predicting election results just using information from _before the campaign starts_. 

What kind of information? Well, one obvious choice is polling data. That gives us a snapshot of public opinion right before the campaign period. As you would expect, support for the incumbent party 3 months before election day is a pretty good predictor of the incumbent party's vote share on election day.

But we can do even better if we include a variable that captures the state of the economy as well. Why? Because voters hold incumbent governments accountable for economic conditions (this is what political scientists call [economic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_voting)) and because the state of the economy is not fully "priced in" before the campaign starts.

The reason for this is simple: voters are [rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance). For most of us, it's just not worth the time and effort to constantly gather information on how the government is performing. 

But as we get closer to election day, the costs of acquiring this information tend to go down (because it's all over the news) and the benefits of acquiring this information tend to go up (because it is increasingly relevant to your voting decision).


So, for example, if we look at data on Google searches for some obvious keywords, there are clear spikes around general elections:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2051_RC11/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"conservative","geo":"GB","time":"2004-01-01 2020-02-25"},{"keyword":"labour","geo":"GB","time":"2004-01-01 2020-02-25"},{"keyword":"election","geo":"GB","time":"2004-01-01 2020-02-25"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&geo=GB&q=conservative,labour,election","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

So, if we can make a good guess about election results before the campaign starts, it doesn't seem like there's much wiggle room for campaign strategists like Dominic Cummings to work their magic. 

What's really interesting, though, is that these "fundamental models" are still as good at predicting election results today as they were 50 years ago -- despite the fact that voter volaility has risen and campaigns are (so they tell us!) becoming more sophisticated. [@nadeau2019election]

  <summary>What does this chart show?</summary>
 <p> This chart shows the size of the prediction error from a simple model based on "fundamentals" (support for incumbent in the polls and GDP growth, both measured 3 months before the election) to predict election results. The "error" is the difference between the incumbent vote share predicted by the model and the actual incumbent vote share in that election. The higher the dot, the larger the prediction error. Most of the errors are under 5 percentage points, though there are a few outliers corresponding to elections in which the incumbent party suffered an historic landslide defeat. The horizontal line is a slightly-fancier version of a moving average. It shows that the size of these prediction errors hasn't changed over time: the fundamental model is as good at predicting elections now as it was in the 1950's! </p>

#### 2. Causal evidence

Another way of exploring the effect of political campaigns is to try to estimate it directly.

Often, this means conducting a field experiment, where the researcher partners with a campaign and randomizes some aspect of the campaign outreach.

<img src="/images/random.gif" alt="Animated gif from the TV show Summer Heights High, in which a character says 'I am so random, I can't believe I just did that...'" width="50%" />

For example, imagine that you have a list of all the households in a certain district, and for each one you flip a coin to determine whether or not that household receives a campaign leaflet. Then you can conduct a follow-up survey of all households in that district and compare the "treatment" and "control" groups to isolate the effect of the leaflets on support for a given candidate or issue.

We can also try to estimate a causal effect even when there wasn't a randomized controlled experiment but, well, that's a subject for another post... 

There are many existing studies that use real-world experiments to estimate the effect of campaign contact on voter behaviour. (Though almost all are from the US context, making it harder to generalize these findings to other countries.) 

Rather than focus on any one particular study, what we really want to do is to somehow _aggregate_ all of the existing evidence.

And luckily for us, political scientists [Josh Kalla](https://twitter.com/j_kalla) and [David Broockman](https://twitter.com/dbroockman) have done just that! They conducted a [_meta-analysis_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/minimal-persuasive-effects-of-campaign-contact-in-general-elections-evidence-from-49-field-experiments/753665A313C4AB433DBF7110299B7433), aggregating evidence from 40 existing studies that estimated the causal effect of campaign contact (mail, phone calls, TV, online ads, canvassing) on voter persuasion. [@kalla2018minimal]

Here's what they found:

>Together, these studies suggest that the most optimistic estimate that could be warranted from the literature is that campaign contact persuades about 1 in 175 voters, but that our best guess is that it persuades about 1 in 800 voters, substantively zero.

That's right. Based on all of the existing evidence, our _best guess_ of the effect of campaign contact during general elections is **zero**. 

The idea that campaigns are not effective at persuading voters shouldn't actually be that surprising to us, for one simple reason: partisanship!

Identifying with a party changes the way we see the world. Arguments that fit with our partisan orientation seem more convincing, and we tend to seek out evidence that fits with our pre-existing views. 

So, while campaign contact isn't very effective at persuading voters in a general election, it *can* have persuasive effects during primary elections and other non-partisan elections (e.g. some judicial elections). 

And campaign contact is certainly effective if your goal is *mobilization* rather than persuasion: meta-analyses of GOTV campaigns consistently suggest they can increase turnout by several percentage points. [@green2019get]

Kalla & Broockman do find some preliminary evidence about a special case where campaign contact _might_ be effective in a general election: if the opponent holds an unusually unpopular position AND the voters don't know that! The example they describe is a Senator from Oregon who wasn't consistently pro-choice on abortion. 

While the "Get Brexit Done" slogan certainly created a contrast between the two major parties' positions on Brexit, 

While the "Get Brexit Done" slogan obviously highlights a difference in clarity between to Tory and Labour positions on Brexit, it was hardly revealing a big secret. And Labour


However... all of the experiments in the Kalla & Broockman meta-analysis are from the US. What if British voters are easier to persuade than American voters? 





@foos2017role PCC. phone call boosts turnout, and if it uses partisan cues it boosts turnout even more among in-partisans. BUT: PCC super low salience. Control group turnout = 13%! Another issue:  






### Secret sauce

So at this point you might be thinking: well, this evidence is about campaign _contact_ not campaign messaging.

And... that's true. It's hard to evaluate how good "Get Brexit Done" is relative to other slogans, because we don't really know what that universe is. 

It's possible that while most campaign persuasion is ineffective - maybe THIS was the one slogan that really did reasonate!

So... first off I will note that this type of "secret sauce" argument is pretty difficult to falsify. 

However, maybe we can test this directly. Suppose that the Get Brexit Done slogan really had an impact. What are some observable implications?

1. increased salience of Brexit during the campaign

2. voters feeling relieved at the prospect of brexit being over

3. increased clarity around the Tory position on Brexit?

### Targeting

OK so maybe it didn't have an impact that we can detect when we look at voters overall - but maybe it was targeted towards some key groups, say swing voters in marginal seats?

Looking at the Conservatives spending on Facebook ads I was struck by a couple things.

First, Get Brexit Done appears fairly often. And it is packaged in various different ways to appeal to different groups. So - if anything - this appears to be a kind of omnibus slogan, and the targeted part comes in the style and format of the ad.

Second, the bulk of Tory ads on Facebook were really about Corbyn.

### Was it actually about persuasion?

So you might be wondering. If political scientists are so convinced that campaign persuasion doesn't really work... why are campaigns still spending so much money on it??

Well - a number of reasons. Campaign operatives don't really have an incentive to make themselves redundant. Also if one side completely gave up the dynamic would be different. Ads might have indirect effects - e.g. generating media coverage on favorable issues? 

But - another possibility. What if these ads are not intended to persuade anyone?

most of these ads click through to a data-gathering exercise.

collecting contact information and political attitudes on lots of people.

not so much about persuasion as identifying voters who already sympathize with you and gathering a BUNCH of data on them.

why? so you can get them to the polls!


this could be used to targeting GOTV efforts.

and NOTE - these actually work!

### How to talk about campaigns

1. Don't say that a slogan/policy/candidate "resonated" with voters. 

2. Memorable slogans don't always reflect the bulk of the messaging that voters receive.

2. Campaigns are more about GOTV than about appealing to swing voters. 

### Walking the walk

The slogan "Get Brexit done" didn't have much effect. But... actually getting Brexit done did! See immediate changes in Gov approval on this and a decline in the salience of the issue.

This shows that the fact that campaigns don't persuade voters doesn't mean that they aren't able or willing to change their views... they justt want to see the proof... 


### So... can voters *ever* be influenced?

Persuasion is hard. Mobilization is more feasible. Meta-analyses of GOTV campaigns show a modest but substantively important effect.

Traditional persuasion = highlighting a candidate's "good" features (e.g. a valence quality, or a position that you think the voter already agrees with)

but other forms of persuasion are more interactive.

Kalla & Broockman - yup the same dudes - did another big study where they showed that it IS possible to persuade people... using deep canvassing. Crucially thouhg, this is on a issue (trans rights) that - while it has become politicized in recent years, is not an issue that most voters have necessarily fit into their core set of political attitudes.
