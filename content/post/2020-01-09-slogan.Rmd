"Get Brexit Done." Those were ["the three words that helped Boris Johnson win"](https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/) Britain's 2019 election, according to Time Magazine.

The slogan was a "[golden key](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/14/get-brexit-done-perhaps-greatest-example-golden-slogan-lifetime/)" that unlocked a Conservative victory, says the Telegraph.

Not to be outdone, this Spectactor columnist thinks it was a "[work of political genius](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/the-genius-of-boriss-brexit-slogan/)", with "power, more power than us smug, clever types who obsess about details and facts naturally recognise".

Even prominent Labour figures like John McDonnell said that the slogan had "[successfully resonated](https://labourlist.org/2019/12/i-dont-think-our-narrative-was-good-enough-says-mcdonnell/)" with voters.

And, of course, behind every good slogun is a mad slogun-slinger.

Enter Dominic Cummings (Vote Leave campaign chief and now advisor to Boris Johnson), the [evil Svengali](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dominic-cummings-evil-svengali-behind-19522317), [master of the dark arts](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street), or (my personal favourite) the Demon Headmaster?^[For the uninitiated: watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dQyPSJYZxk), but don't look into his eyes!]

So... is this narrative true? 

Did the "Get Brexit Done" slogan actually affect the election result?

Do campaign slogans really have the power to change minds?

### Reasons for skepticism



#### 1. Fundamentals

One big reason for being skeptical about campaign effects is that we can do a pretty big job at predicting election results just using information from _before the campaign starts_. 

Typically the predictors we use are "fundamental" factors like the state of the economy and the government's approval rating in the polls, measured before the formal campaign period begins. 

Interestingly, even in the age of waning party attachments and (supposedly) more sophisticated campaigns, fundamental factors do as good a job at predicting election results now as they did 50 years ago [@nadeau2019election].

  <summary>What does this chart show?</summary>
 <p> This chart shows the size of the prediction error from a simple model based on "fundamentals" (support for incumbent in the polls and GDP growth, both measured 3 months before the election) to predict election results. The "error" is just the difference between the incumbent vote share predicted by the model and the actual incumbent vote share in that election. The higher the dot, the larger the prediction error. The horizontal line is a slightly-fancier version of a moving average. It shows that the size of these prediction errors hasn't changed over time: the fundamental model is as good at predicting elections now as it was 60 years ago! </p>

#### 2. Experimental evidence

If we _really_ want to know whether something has a causal effect, then, just like if we were testing whether a new drug helps with a certain disease, we need to do a controlled experiment. 

How does this work for political "treatments" instead of medical ones? Well, typically a researcher will partner with a political candidate or party, and convince them to randomize some aspect of their campaign - e.g. by flipping a coin to decide which houses to canvass, or which markets to air TV ads, or which addresses to send leaflets.

Political scientists have been doing this sort of thing for a while, though most of the experimental evidence comes from the US context. In fact, there are enough studies out there using fairly similar designs that we can combine them in a "meta-analysis". 

A meta-analysis lets us answer the question: given all of these studies, what is our best guess of the true effect of campaign contact on voter behaviour?


Well, thanks to Josh Kalla and David Broockman 
The first meta-analysis focuses on personal campaign contact (phone calls or door-to-door canvassing) and aggregates evidence from 49 field experiments [@kalla2018minimal]. The authors conclude that "the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans' candidates choices in general elections is zero".



### Walking the walk

The slogan "Get Brexit done" didn't have much effect. But... actually getting Brexit done did! See immediate changes in Gov approval on this and a decline in the salience of the issue.

This shows that the fact that campaigns don't persuade voters doesn't mean that they aren't able or willing to change their views... they justt want to see the proof... 


### So... can voters *ever* be influenced?

Persuasion is hard. Mobilization is more feasible. Meta-analyses of GOTV campaigns show a modest but substantively important effect.

Traditional persuasion = highlighting a candidate's "good" features (e.g. a valence quality, or a position that you think the voter already agrees with)

but other forms of persuasion are more interactive.

Kalla & Broockman - yup the same dudes - did another big study where they showed that it IS possible to persuade people... using deep canvassing. Crucially thouhg, this is on a issue (trans rights) that - while it has become politicized in recent years, is not an issue that most voters have necessarily fit into their core set of political attitudes.
