My name is Sophie Hill. I'm a PhD student in political science at Harvard.

I decided to start this blog when - at some point during the UK 2019 election - I realized that most politicians and pundits were able to discuss the intricacies of multilevel regression with poststratification, but seemed... erm, less well-versed in the core concepts and theories from political science.  

So, the aim of this blog is to make academic political science accessible and relevant, by applying it to topical news stories in a (mostly) jargon-free way.
